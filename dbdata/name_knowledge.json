After thwarting the murder attempt, Gwen found herself held at gunpoint by her father, and she was forced to reveal her double identity. She pleaded her innocence, and swore to never rest until criminals like the Kingpin were stopped.

She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.\n    Hu Tao may seem like all play and no work, spending every free moment on leisure and being widely considered a laissez-faire business owner.\n    It is only during funeral ceremonies, when she personally leads her undertakers through lamp-lit alleys, that she shows her dignified and solemn side.\n    At first glance, she appears to be a quirky and cheerful girl. No one would think that she is actually the renowned and illustrious Hu Tao.\n    Whether she is acting as the Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor or as Liyue Harbor's \"famous\" poet, Hu Tao's nature is exceedingly eccentric.

She appears at any time and at any place. From bustling streets to barren alleys, to derelict mountains and desolate peaks, in radiant and refulgent skies, or shadowed and starless night... Anything is possible \u2014 anything can become full of wonder.\n    Hu Tao is an undecipherable riddle, but people don't lament their lack of an answer. If asked, they would say, \"This is the natural order of things, right?

It cannot be performed based on impressions and personal habits.\"\n    Of all the lecturers, Zhongli is the most revered one. As such, his lessons have proven to be the most effective in cultivating the competence of Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's undertakers.\n    Despite often being teased by Hu Tao due to his old-fashioned style, he is also the person that she trusts the most.\n    Apart from that, Hu Tao always instructs her undertakers to respect their clients' wishes and not insist on any particular form of funeral.\n    \"Some clients want nothing more than a peaceful ceremony; some opt for a more lively style of event.

At first, she examined the lions with a thoughtful look, but soon enough, her pensive face gave way to a wide smile, as she slapped them on the fore-paws.\n    From that moment on, Hu Tao often visited and petted the stone statues. Not only would she talk to them, but also give them pet names \u2014 Whiskers for the one on the left and Mittens for the one on the right.\n    On occasion, she would even bring a bucket of water and a big brush to bathe them, each move so careful and deliberate that one might think that they were her.\n    As it happened, another feline, a living and breathing calico cat, could be found enjoying the local delicacies in front of Xinyue Kiosk, not too far from the ministry building.

Soft footsteps could often be heard in front of the building at around midnight. Initially, the guards suspected that it had been a thief preparing to rob officials.

For its 75th Director, Wangsheng Funeral Parlor held a grand funeral, in accordance with the last wishes of the old man himself, to be conducted by Hu Tao.\n    Only thirteen at the time, Hu Tao, who would later go on to become the Director in turn, made all the arrangements herself to the highest standard, greatly impressing the undertakers.\n    After the funeral, the thirteen-year-old Hu Tao grabbed her traveler's bag and crept out alone in the dead of night. In her bag were only a few rations, some water, and a means to create some light.

For Hu Tao, this journey was a chance to see her grandfather once more before he departed forever.\n    For two days she journeyed unceasingly before finally arriving at her destination, yet was unable to locate her grandfather upon arrival. Between the innumerable spirits she walked, but not one of them resembled the old man.\n    She stayed there the whole day before falling asleep in exhaustion, awakening to a night sky and heavy dew. Around her were gathered a few lone spirits, clapping and laughing: \"Silly girl, why would Old Hu be here of all places? What were you thinking, looking for your relatives here?\"\n    Not one to be swayed so easily, Hu Tao continued to wait, day after day. Her rations gradually disappeared and her water supplies drained away, but her grandfather did not appear. In the end, it was a little old woman who came to her.\n    She laid eyes on the exhausted Hu Tao and smiled as she spoke: \"Look at your stubbornness. You're exactly like Old Hu. It's a shame, but none of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor Directors would ever linger here. You come from a family of plain speakers, so let me return the favor... Go back. Go back to where you came from.\"\n    The old woman bid farewell to Hu Tao, before passing over the border and into the distance. Hu Tao watched as the figure of the mysterious woman grew smaller and disappeared, as a sense of doubt tinged with relief manifested itself.\n    t last she came to the conclusion: her grandfather's absence was due to him having passed over the border as soon as he'd arrived, to the place where he was bound. He had been open and honest in life, leaving behind no regrets, so was it right for his departure to be framed in regretful terms? \n    With a smile, she set forth on the return journey.\n    The faraway moon had been casting a thin light on the way over but had now been replaced by the bright light of dawn. As she walked, Hu Tao thought of a saying that her grandfather had often quoted: \"Live in life, die in death. Follow your heart, do what you can.\"\n    It was noon when Hu Tao arrived home. She climbed over the wall into the rear courtyard, went straight to her room, and unpacked her travel bag.\n    With her food and water long gone, and the rest of her belongings unpacked, the bag she had taken for empty instead contained a colorful Vision. Just when had it arrived?\n    s one of the few living that had dared to visit the border, perhaps Hu Tao's actions had moved some unknown god.\n    Perhaps this then constituted a heavenly gift... the ultimate recognition of her strength."}, {"name": "457-klee", "knowledge": "A recurring gag in the game is calling Paimon \"Emergency Food.\"\nThe first instance of this can be found in the Archon Quest Wind-Riding Knight in Prologue: Act I - The Outlander Who Caught the Wind, where the Traveler, during their first meeting with Amber, has the option of introducing Paimon as \"Emergency Food.\"\nWhile having a conversation with Little Xing, Little Xing questions if Paimon is \"some kind of food?\"\nDuring Friendship in Writing in Yae Miko's Story Quest, Divina Vulpes Chapter: Act I - The Great Narukami Offering, the Traveler is tasked with forming ideas for a short novel based on their travels.
